This project simulates real-world industry tasks, such as understanding and updating legacy code. It involves moving from a bare-metal design to one that uses a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The software is redesigned and refactored using a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to make it easier to modify and test. An automated testing framework is also added to support long-term maintenance.
