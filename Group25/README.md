# ENCE464 Fitness Monitor Project

This repository contains the code and build system for the ENCE464 Fitness
Monitor project, to run on the
[Texas Instruments TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). 

## Repository structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* `docs`: Instructions for building and running the project code, and installing the
  development toolchain on your own computer. Also contains Fitness Monitor v1.0 
  documentation and some additional project help.
* `labs`: Supporting code for your lab sessions.
* `target`: Code that targets the LaunchPad; contains the main project code,
  libraries, and a few simple demo programs.
* `tests`: Tests targeting the host (development) machine.
* `.vscode`: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) configuration files.

## üöÄ Getting started

The project is set up for development using Microsoft _Visual Studio Code_, the 
_CMake_ build system, the _GCC ARM_ cross-compiler, and _OpenOCD_. 

### Toolchain setup

If you're working on a UC Embedded Systems Lab (ESL) computer then you should find that the 
necessary toolchain is pre-installed. 

If you want to build the project on _your personal machine_ you'll need to make sure that you 
install all of the necessary tools. Check the toolchain installation guide for your operating system:

* [Windows](docs/toolchain.md#windows)
* [Linux](docs/toolchain.md#linux)
* [macOS](docs/toolchain.md#macos)

### Building the code 

Assuming that you have the [toolchain installed](#toolchain), you can use the command line or _VS Code_ to 
build the code and program your LaunchPad. Here are instructions on building/programming using each approach:

* [VS Code](docs/vs-code.md)
* [Command line](docs/cli.md)

See the [CMake guide](docs/cmake.md) for additional info on performing various tasks with
the CMake build system.

For tips on debugging and fixing common issues, including some common FreeRTOS
errors, see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).
