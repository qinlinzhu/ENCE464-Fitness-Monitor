# ENCE361 Step Counter

Developed by Matthew Suter, Tim Preston-Marshall, Daniel Rabbidge in 2022

Complile this project with heap and stack sizes set to 512 bytes! (or greater)


Notes on assignment ideas for the 464 project:
- Unify the ugly dependency structure of ```buttons_manager``` depending on ```switches``` and ```buttons4```
- Fix the code duplication between the int and vector3 circular buffers. In reality, the acceleration doesn't need to be stored as a vector anyway
